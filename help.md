## Welcome to Simple IRIS Dataset Explorer

This application is based on the IRIS dataset in R. It allows user to explore IRIS data via a pre-defined chart type. In the application, user can:

- Choose a variables from IRIS as X or Y-Axis of the plot, except `Species` which is fixed as the grouping of the points.
- Adjust some of the plot settings like Point Size, Point Opacity and Span.

**Note**: If same variable is choosen for both X and Y-Axis, Y-Axis variable will be automatically adjusted to 'Length' if X is 'Width' and vice versa but will remain as same category ('Pedal' or 'Sepal') as in X.
